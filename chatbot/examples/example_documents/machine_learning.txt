Machine Learning Introduction

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include:
- Classification: Predicting categories (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (house prices, stock prices)

Common supervised learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Examples include:
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features
- Association Rules: Finding relationships between variables

Common unsupervised learning algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves agents that learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Machine Learning Process:
1. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data
3. Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features
4. Model Selection: Choosing appropriate algorithm
5. Training: Teaching the model using training data
6. Evaluation: Testing model performance
7. Deployment: Implementing the model in production
